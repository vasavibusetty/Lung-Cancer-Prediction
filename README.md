# Lung-Cancer-Prediction
This project focuses on building an advanced Machine Learning model to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on patient health data. By analyzing factors such as age, smoking history, family health background, BMI, cholesterol levels, and more, the model helps in early detection, which is critical for improving treatment outcomes.
